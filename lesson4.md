# Opening a New Case, Part 2

In this topic we'll talk about the sections of Janus you use after you calculate a case. We’ll also talk about the _Action Bar_ at the bottom of the working area.

The three sections that require the case to be calculated are _Benefits, Gross to Net_, and _Add/Deduct_. Let’s take a look at each one of these.

## Benefits

The Benefits section provides the core information about the annuitant’s retirement benefits. This section provides a tabular view of the resulting calculations.  Let’s dive into the table.

Of course, the specific values depend on each case’s details. This illustration shows a realistic result for an annuitant. 

The most significant and frequently referenced values appear as bold text. This makes them easy to locate when the table is larger and more complex. They also act as waypoints, showing the values that are derived along the way as the annuity computation progresses.

The main components of a benefits table include:

* The ability to select a run if available. For a basic case, the only run you can select is **Basic annuity**
* The _Basic annuity _column 
* The _Annuity_ section, which shows the elements making up the annuity
* The  _Unpaid_ section (if applicable)
* The _Service_ section, which shows details of the service

Rows that have subordinate data allow you to show or hide that detail. To do so, select the arrow at the beginning of a row.

In addition, the table’s header stays fixed at the top of the work area just under the _Benefits_ section header so that, when you scroll the table, you can understand the context of the columns. This feature makes it very helpful in more complex tables.

Below the table, Janus provides additional reference information as well as summaries of average salaries.

Let’s take a look at a more complex benefits result. This example illustrates a case with multiple runs and with the table fully expanded, to reveal reductions and costs. Keep in mind that this example shows all possible line items. Some items appear only under particular case conditions.

## Gross to Net

Now let’s look at the _Gross to Net_ section. It shows you a breakdown of the annuitant’s monthly annuity payment, showing the gross annuity rate. Though this table provides a lot of information, you can scroll it left and right in order to access the table’s data. 

Elements that this table provides includes items affecting the gross amount for each effective date. These items include both, items that increase the gross (such as cost-of-living adjustments, or COLAs),  and then the items that reduce the gross amount, for example, the costs for health benefits or life insurance. 

Each case shows different items. 


## Add/Deduct

Now we'll move to the _Add/Deduct_ area. 

Here you provide the information that Janus uses to set up both collections due from the annuitant as well as payments owed to them.

Each tab allows you to enter the appropriate information. You can enter additions, deductions or both for:

* Basic annuity
* Deposit paid
* Re/Deposit paid
* All paid

Here’s how you enter the information:

1. After you calculate, Janus determines the annuitant’s eligibility and shows the add/deduct section.
2. If the annuitant is eligible, then you  enter the annual deductions. Remember that the _Amount_ field contains monthly amounts. 
3. Calculate again.  \
Janus populates the appropriate code 67s in Add/deduct — one for accumulated to date, one for paid out as a single installment, and one for future installments.

## Action Bar

At the bottom of the work area, you have the _Action Bar._ This area provides the place to invoke those actions that affect the case.

The selections you have available depend both on your role, as well as the state or mode you might be in. For most cases you work on, the Action Bar shows these items:

* _Calculate_
* _View summary_
* _Submit for review_
* _Additional case actions_

The _Additional case actions_ link shows you other actions you can take. Again, _Additional case actions _shows you options based on your role as well as the type of case. For the most part, however, you’ll see these actions:

* Change status
* Edit scratch pad data
* Edit face brief data
* Close case
